    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Yass la menace.
\n\n I love CrossFit, couscous and  Mafé 🏋 .
\n\nTship tchip tchip .
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
